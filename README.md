## 🔍 Key Business Insights

- High discounts (40%+) **significantly hurt profitability** across all regions
- **Texas, Ohio & Pennsylvania** show high sales but **negative profit**
- Technology is the highest revenue-generating category
- Top 10 customers contribute a disproportionate share of revenue

---

## 💡 Business Recommendation

Discount rates above 40% consistently result in negative profit margins across 
all regions. **Immediate action:** cap discounts at 20% for Furniture and Office 
Supplies categories in Texas, Ohio, and Pennsylvania — these three states alone 
show $50K+ in losses despite strong sales volume.
